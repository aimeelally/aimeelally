#Skeleton Angular App
This is the skeleton of an Angular app, with a basic transpiling, bundling and minifying build process.

##Building Skeleton
1. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
2. Run `npm start` to build and launch the app

##Development Notes
###Bundling additional views
1. Add a folder to `views/` with the name of the view in kebab case
2. Create a new file within views with the name of the controller in camel case and export your controller object from it. (If you need an example check one of the controllers provided.)
3. Add your controller to `views/index.js`, following the format already there. The bundler will automatically register your controller and add it to the bundle.

###Bundling additional sass files
* From `app.scss`, you can `@import "./<path>";` additional sass files, which will be compiled and bundled into `app.bundle.css`.
* You can also add partial sass files to templates using a `<link />` tag which will then be inlined into the template.

###Including assets
* Any files and folders located in `assets/` will be copied directly over to the app, retaining their directory structure.
* The same is done for `data/`, but in an actual webapp this would most likely be dynamically generated by a backend, so it is just used to show how the app would work in a full stack environment.
